Additional Comments:

This looks great! All your JavaScript is working! And good use of pseudocode.

One little thing: line 6 and line 11 are basically the same. You don't need to have that twice. It's not causing any problems, but you could condense rows 6-13 like this:
  $("#submit-btn").on("click", function(event) {
     event.preventDefault();
     displayCityImage();
  });

The only other thing is that it's better to use === in the conditional (instead of ==). === is more exact than == (which sometimes gives you weird results). For instance:
  3 == "3"    is true (even though "3" is a string, not a number) but
  3 === "3"   is false like you'd expect
Basically, unless you have a specific reason to use ==, it's better to use ===.

Overall, nice job! Let me know if you have any questions.


Also, your wireframes for your final project look really good. Very thorough. I think that a portfolio site will be a nice project to work on. That's great that you've thought through all the different pages. (And if you don't have time to complete the whole thing during class, you can keep working on it afterwards.)
