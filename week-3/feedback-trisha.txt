Additional Comments:

Trisha, this looks great! You did an awesome job. You are definitely getting the hang of HTML & CSS!

A couple really little things:

On line 57 in your HTML, that <div> doesn't have a closing tag. That's an easy typo to make (but luckily, also easy to fix).

I noticed you're using <hr>s for your lines. That works -- it's not really wrong -- but since it's a stylistic thing, it's better to put that in your CSS. You can do something like:
.post {
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}

By doing the line in CSS, you have more control over how it looks.

Those are really small things. Overall, great job!
