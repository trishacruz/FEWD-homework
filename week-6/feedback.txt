Create an array with the following values: "NYC", "SF", "LA", "ATX", "SYD"; use the array to add values to the <select> menu by using a for loop in JavaScript (don't update the HTML to do this!)
 - Good!
When the user changes the input of the drop-down, update the background image based on what they selected
 - Good, but there are a few mistakes causing problems with a couple options. See additional comments.
Use $.append() in your iteration on the drop-down menu
 - Good!
Use the $.attr() function to update html classes
 - You can use .attr("class") to set a class, but .addClass() & .removeClass() work just as well
Get the value of user input using $.val()
 - Good!
Use the $.change event handler to capture user actions
 - Good!
Use if/else if/else conditionals to control the flow of your application
 - Good, but since you are controlling the values with a 'select' control you don't need the additional options ("NY", "New York", etc.)
Display your pseudocode as Javascript comments
 - Comments can help keep your code understandable for yourself and for other developers

 Additional Comments:

 - Good job. The functionality is mostly working and your code is clean and well indented.

 - The NYC option isn't working because of this jquery selector: $(".nyc") - it should be $("body")

 - Your SF options isn't working because of this condiditonal check: city == "Bay Area" - it should be "SF"
